      The German Shepherd[a] or Alsatian is a German breed of working dog of
      medium to large size. The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz using
      various traditional German herding dogs from 1899. It was originally bred
      as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been used in many other
      types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police
      work, and warfare. It is commonly kept as a companion dog, and according
      to the Fédération Cynologique Internationale had the second-highest number
      of annual registrations in 2013. <sup>[2]</sup>

      <h1>German Shepherd</h1>
      <hr />
      <p>
        The German Shepherd[a] or Alsatian is a German breed of working dog of
        medium to large size. The breed was developed by Max von Stephanitz
        using various traditional German herding dogs from 1899. It was
        originally bred as a herding dog, for herding sheep. It has since been
        used in many other types of work, including disability assistance,
        search-and-rescue, police work, and warfare. It is commonly kept as a
        companion dog, and according to the Fédération Cynologique
        Internationale had the second-highest number of annual registrations in
        2013. <sup>[2]</sup>
      </p>

      <h2>History</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        During the 1890s, attempts were being made to standardise dog breeds.[3]
        Dogs were being bred to preserve traits that assisted in their job of
        herding sheep and protecting their flocks from predators.[4] In Germany
        this was practised within local communities, where shepherds selected
        and bred dogs. It was recognised that the breed had the necessary skills
        for herding sheep, such as intelligence, speed, strength and keen senses
        of smell.[4] The results were dogs that were able to do such things, but
        that differed significantly, both in appearance and ability, from one
        locality to another.[3]
      </p>
      <p>
        To combat these differences, the Phylax Society was formed in 1891 with
        the intention of creating standardised development plans for native dog
        breeds in Germany.[4] The society disbanded after only three years due
        to ongoing internal conflicts regarding the traits in dogs that the
        society should promote;[4] some members believed dogs should be bred
        solely for working purposes, while others believed dogs should be bred
        also for appearance.[5] While unsuccessful in their goal, the Phylax
        Society had inspired people to pursue standardising dog breeds
        independently.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the rise of large, industrialised cities in Germany, the predator
        population began to decline, rendering sheepdogs unnecessary.[4] At the
        same time, the awareness of sheepdogs as a versatile, intelligent class
        of canine began to rise.[4] Max von Stephanitz, an ex-cavalry captain
        and former student of the Berlin Veterinary College, was an ex-member of
        the Phylax Society who firmly believed dogs should be bred for
        working.[4] He admired the intelligence, strength and ability of
        Germany's native sheepdogs, but could not find any one single breed that
        satisfied him as the perfect working dog.[4]
      </p>
      <h3>Naming</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        The breed was named Deutscher Schäferhund, by von Stephanitz, literally
        translating to "German Shepherd Dog".[19] At the time, all other herding
        dogs in Germany were referred to by this name; they thus became known as
        Altdeutsche Schäferhunde, or old German herding dogs. The direct
        translation of the name was adopted for use in the stud-book; however,
        at the end of the First World War, it was believed that the inclusion of
        the word "German" would harm the breed's popularity,[20] due to the
        anti-German sentiment of the era.[21] The breed was officially renamed
        by the UK Kennel Club to "Alsatian Wolf Dog",[20] after the French
        region of Alsace bordering Germany.[4] Eventually,[when?] the appendage
        "wolf dog" was dropped,[20] after numerous campaigns by breeders who
        were worried that becoming known as a wolf-dog hybrid would affect the
        breed's popularity and legality.[4] The name Alsatian remained for five
        decades,[20] until 1977, when successful campaigns by dog enthusiasts
        pressured the British kennel clubs to allow the breed to be registered
        again as German Shepherds.[22] The word "Alsatian" once appeared in
        parentheses as part of the formal breed name of the American Kennel Club
        and was removed in 2010.[23]

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        German Shepherds are medium to large-sized dogs.[24] The breed standard
        height at the withers is 60–65 cm (24–26 in) for males, and 55–60 cm
        (22–24 in) for females.[25][26][27] German Shepherds can reach sprinting
        speeds of up to 30 miles per hour.[28] Shepherds are longer than they
        are tall, with an ideal proportion of 10 to 8+1⁄2. The AKC official
        breed standard does not set a standard weight range.[29] They have a
        domed forehead, a long square-cut muzzle with strong jaws and a black
        nose. The eyes are medium-sized and brown. The ears are large and stand
        erect, open at the front and parallel, but they often are pulled back
        during movement. A German Shepherd has a long neck, which is raised when
        excited and lowered when moving at a fast pace as well as stalking. The
        tail is bushy and reaches to the hock.[26]

        alt="Saddle black-and-tan coat"
      />
      <h3>Intelligence</h3>
      <article>
        German Shepherds were bred specifically for their intelligence.[32] In a
        list of breeds most likely to bark as watchdogs, Stanley Coren ranked
        the breed in second place.[33] Coupled with their strength, this trait
        makes the breed desirable as police, guard and search and rescue dogs,
        as they are able to quickly learn various tasks and interpret
        instructions better than other breeds.[34]
      </article>
      <h2>Temperament</h2>

      <hr />
      <p>
        German Shepherds are moderately active dogs and are described in breed
        standards as self assured.[29] The breed is marked by a willingness to
        learn and an eagerness to have a purpose. They are curious, which makes
        them excellent guard dogs and suitable for search missions. They can
        become overprotective of their family and territory, especially if not
        socialised correctly.[35] They are not inclined to become immediate
        friends with strangers.[36] German Shepherds are highly intelligent and
        obedient, as well as protective of their owners.[37]
      </p>
      <h3>Aggression and biting</h3>
      <p>
        A 2020 literature review in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery found
        that from 1971 to 2018, of all pure breed dogs in the United States, the
        German Shepherd was responsible for the most bites severe enough to
        require hospital treatment.[38] While an Australian report from 1999
        provides statistics showing that German Shepherds are the breed third
        most likely to attack a person in some Australian locales,[39] once
        their popularity is taken into account, the percentages of attacks by
        German Shepherds drops to 38th.[40] According to the National Geographic
        Channel television show Dangerous Encounters, the bite of a German
        Shepherd has a force of over 1,060 newtons (238 lbf) (compared with that
        of a Rottweiler, over 1,180–1,460 newtons (265–328 lbf), a Pit bull,
        1,050 newtons (235 lbf), a Labrador Retriever, of approximately 1,000
        newtons (230 lbf), or a human, of approximately 380 newtons (86
        lbf)).[41]
      </p>
      <h2>Modern breed</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        The modern German Shepherd breed is criticised by experts for straying
        away from Max von Stephanitz's original ideology that German Shepherds
        should be bred primarily as working dogs and that breeding should be
        strictly controlled to eliminate defects quickly.[42]: 6 [43] He
        believed that, above all else, German Shepherds should be bred for
        intelligence and working ability.[4]

            The East-European Shepherd is a variety of the German Shepherd bred
            in the former Soviet Union with the purpose of creating a larger,
            more cold-resistant version of the German Shepherd. It lacks the
            physical deformities bred into western show lines of German
            Shepherds and has become one of Russia's most popular dog types.[49]

            The Shiloh Shepherd is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in the
            United States. It was developed in the 1970s and 1980s to correct
            behavioural and conformational issues that have been bred into
            modern German Shepherds, and was bred for its large size, length of
            back, temperament and soundness of hips.[51][52] It has been
            recognised since 1990 by the American Rare Breed Association.[53]

            The White Shepherd is a variety of the German Shepherd bred in the
            United States. White-coated German Shepherds were once banned from
            registration in their native Germany, but in the United States and
            Canada the coloration gained a following and a breed club was formed
            specifically for white German Shepherds, calling their variety the
            White Shepherd. The variety is recognised as a separate breed by the
            United Kennel Club.[54]

            The White Swiss Shepherd Dog (French: Berger Blanc Suisse, German:
            Weisser Schweizer Schäferhund, Italian: Pastore Svizzero Bianco) is
            a variety of the German Shepherd bred in Switzerland. It descends
            from the American White Shepherds; the first stud dog of what was to
            become the breed was an American dog born in 1966 and imported to
            Switzerland. The variety was recognised by the Fédération
            Cynologique Internationale as a separate breed in 2003, and it is
            now recognised by a number of national kennel clubs.[54]
